                <p>That's the whole point of this website. It has no political affiliation whatsoever. It's just a platform for people to exchange ideas, and for the public at large to see what has been achieved by the government.</p>

	             	<p>Of course comments posted by people can be political and everyone is free to agree or disagree with a promise - it's a free and open platform, and is open to everyone. However, the status of a particular promise is solely based on evidence - news articles, official government documents, or anything that everyone will agree is concrete evidence of what's being done.</p>
